# Given a string , which is the company name in lowercase letters, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string.
# Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count.
# Sort in descending order of occurrence count.
# If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order.
# For example, according to the conditions described above,
# GOOGLE would have it's logo with the letters G,O,E.
# Sample Input 0
# aabbbccde
# Sample Output 0
# b 3
# a 2
# c 2
# Explanation 0
# aabbbccde
# Here, b occurs 3 times. It is printed first.
# Both a and c occur 2 times. So, a is printed in the second line and c in the third line because a comes before c in the alphabet.
# Note: The string S has at least 3 distinct characters.
