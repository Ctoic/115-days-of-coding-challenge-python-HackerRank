# Task
# You are given a space separated list of integers. If all the integers are positive, then you need to check if any integer is a palindromic integer.
# Sample Input
# 5
# 12 9 61 5 14 
# Sample Output
# True
# Explanation
# Condition 1: All the integers in the list are positive.
# Condition 2: 5 is a palindromic integer.
# Hence, the output is True.
# Can you solve this challenge in 3 lines of code or less?
# There is no penalty for solutions that are correct but have more than 3 lines.
