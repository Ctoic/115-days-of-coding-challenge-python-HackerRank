# Task
# The National University conducts an examination of N students in X subjects.
# Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.
# AVG = Sum of score obtained in all sub by Student / total no of student
# The format for the general mark sheet is:
# Student ID â†’ ___1_____2_____3_____4_____5__               
# Subject 1   |  89    90    78    93    80
# Subject 2   |  90    91    85    88    86  
# Subject 3   |  91    92    83    89    90.5
#             |______________________________
# Average        90    91    82    90    85.5 
# Sample Input

# 5 3
# 89 90 78 93 80
# 90 91 85 88 86  
# 91 92 83 89 90.5
# Sample Output

# 90.0 
# 91.0 
# 82.0 
# 90.0 
# 85.5        
# Explanation
# Marks obtained by student 1: 89, 90, 91
# Average marks of student 1: 270/3 = 90
# Marks obtained by student 2: 90, 91, 92
# Average marks of student 2: 273/3 = 91
# Marks obtained by student 3: 78, 85, 83
# Average marks of student 3: 246/3 = 82
# Marks obtained by student 4: 93, 88, 89
# Average marks of student 4: 270/3 = 90
# Marks obtained by student 5: 80, 86, 90.5
# Average marks of student 5: 256.5/3 = 85.5
