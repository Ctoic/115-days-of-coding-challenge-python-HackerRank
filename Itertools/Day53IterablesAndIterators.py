# Sample Input
# 4 
# a a c d
# 2
# Sample Output
# 0.8333
# Explanation
# All possible unordered tuples of length  comprising of indices from 1 to 4 are:
# (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)
# Out of these 6 combinations, 5 of them contain either index 1 or index 2 which are the indices that contain the letter 'a'.
# Hence, the answer is 5/6 => 0.8333.
