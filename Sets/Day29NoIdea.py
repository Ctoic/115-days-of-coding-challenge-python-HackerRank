# There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B.
# Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i âˆˆ A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i âˆˆ B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change.
# Output your final happiness at the end.

# Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.
